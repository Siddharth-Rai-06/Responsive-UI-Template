# Responsive UI Template

This project aims to showcase a simple responsive UI for laptop as well as mobile screens. 
It uses media query to make the UI look smooth on a device of width smaller than 600px.

## Components

###  Responsive Navbar

The navbar in this project contains two sub-parts. One is the brand name and other is the navigation menu.
On laptop the navbar is a single line with both sub components floating to left and right respectively.
On mobile screens, both sub-parts get center aligned and stack on top of each other.

### Home Page

The home page consists of a simple ui which shows two major divs which contains image and texts. On laptop the
text and image are aligned side by side. As the screen size becomes small, they stack on top of each other and 
the two divs resize to maintain the width ratio.


### Project Page

The project page, which can be navigated from the navbar displays a total of 9 images positioned using grids.
Upon downsizing the screen, all the images decrease in ratio to the screen and each image now occupies 90% of 
the screen width. Hence the images stack upon each other vertically given them a smooth finish.
